Notes Jun-12, 2014
========================================================

Had a few new thoughts since yesterday:

* Post titles often have tags pre-appended to them, like [OFFER], [REQUEST], [THANKS] and [META]. Posts that have the [OFFER], [META], or [THANKS] tag should be set to not fulfilled. I'll have to verify this but it makes sense that the only posts getting fulfilled must have an [OFFER] tag or no tag at all.
* If the post was edited, more likely then not they are probably saying "Thanks!" in the edit.

So for now I'm just going to play with the data and see what cool things I can find out.

## Checking Edits

Going to check the edited part first. I started by making a simple table of edited vs. fulfilled, but got a lot of strange values for whether the post was edited. I wonder what that's about? I'll probably need to find a way to clean it up. For now, I'll just categorize those funny data points as "funny".

```{R}
editTable <- table(dTrain$post_was_edited, dTrain$requester_received_pizza)
editTable <- as.data.frame.matrix(editTable)
editTable <- editTable[3:nrow(editTable),] # Isolate messy data

# For some reason a table returns strange results, so will do this manually
editTableFalse <- editTable[,1]
editTableTrue <- editTable[,2]
```

The results for the funny edit data to fulfillment were...

FALSE | TRUE
--- | ---
203 | 96

Bummer! I was hoping it'd be more unanimous one way. Anyway, let's report on the statistic that I care about for now...

```{R}
editTable <- table(dTrain$post_was_edited, dTrain$requester_received_pizza)
editTable <- as.data.frame.matrix(editTable)
editTable <- editTable[1:2,]
editTable[3,] <- c(203, 96)
```

Edit Status | FALSE | TRUE
--- | --- | ---
No Edit | 2646 (77.9%) | 749 (22.1%)
Edit | 197 (56.9%) | 149 (43.1%)
Funny | 203 (67.9%) | 96 (32.1%)
Control | 3046 (75.4%) | 994 (24.6%)

So this is a little interesting. Compared to the control population (fulfillments for total population), posts that were edited are fulfilled 43% of the time, whereas the total population is 25% of the time. So edits could be an indicator, but it is not as overwhelming as I hoped it would be.

## Checking Post Tags

First I need to isolate post tags.

```{R}
dTag <- dTrain$request_title
dTag <- as.data.frame(dTag)

# Make a strsplit that can work on a test case for posts with brackets
a <- as.character(dTag[2,]) # Test case
strsplit(a, split='\\[|]')[[1]][2] # Returns the tag

# Account for posts with no tags
b <- as.character(dTag[8,])
strsplit(a, split='\\[|]')[[1]][2] # Returns NA, which is what we want

# Account for posts with tags in parantheses
d <- as.character(dTag[326,])
strsplit(d, split='\\(|)')[[1]][2] # Returns the tag

# Account for posts that tagged without a delimiter
# Check if first word is a keyword (request, meta, offer)
f <- as.character(dTag[655,])
strsplit(f, split=' ')[[1]][1] # Returns the first word
toupper(strsplit(f, split=' ')[[1]][1]) == "REQUEST" # Checks the first word

# Now, make a function that can do all of this
```

So as I started writing the function, isoTag, to isolate the post tag, I realized something... I was scanning the post titles in the training set and realized that all of them were request posts. There was one (INFO) post, but not too many posts of other categories. Maybe this dataset was already scrubbed to look at post requests only?

I did see something of interest, though. It is fairly frequent that posts have a [UK] label on them. I wonder if people in the UK get pizza'd frequently? Maybe the primarily American audience love British people, or maybe they don't like buying pizza in Pounds? Going to write some quick code to identify UK populations...

```{R}
uk <- as.character(dTag[30,1])
grepl("UK", uk)
```

Let's apply it and see what sort of results we get.

```{R}
dTag$UK <- NA # Initialize
dTag$dTag <- as.character(dTag$dTag)
dTag$UK <- sapply(dTag$dTag, FUN=function(x) grepl("UK",x))
```

It worked! Now let's isolate and take a look at what we've got here...

Status | Not Fulfilled | Fulfilled
--- | --- | ---
Not UK | 2951 (75.3%) | 964 (24.6%)
UK | 95 (76%) | 30 (24%)

So looks like being in the UK has no influence on whether you get pizza or not!

Anyway, before I wrap up this post title stuff for now, I should make absolutely sure that all posts are request posts.

```{R}
dTrain$bRequest <- sapply(dTrain$request_title, FUN=function(x) grepl("request", x, ignore.case=TRUE))
check <- subset(dTrain, select=c("bRequest","request_title"))
View(check[check$bRequest==FALSE,])
```

Yup, all posts flagged false in that bit of code are request posts which were flagged as "REQ" instead of "REQUEST".

Anyway, big conclusion from this so far: It looks like post tags shouldn't have influence since all the post titles have been seemingly scrubbed to show just requests. I should look at the actual data more closely before starting to analyze.
