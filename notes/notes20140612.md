Notes Jun-12, 2014
========================================================

Had a few new thoughts since yesterday:

* Post titles often have tags pre-appended to them, like [OFFER], [REQUEST], [THANKS] and [META]. Posts that have the [OFFER], [META], or [THANKS] tag should be set to not fulfilled. I'll have to verify this but it makes sense that the only posts getting fulfilled must have an [OFFER] tag or no tag at all.
* If the post was edited, more likely then not they are probably saying "Thanks!" in the edit.

So for now I'm just going to play with the data and see what cool things I can find out.

## Checking Edits

Going to check the edited part first. I started by making a simple table of edited vs. fulfilled, but got a lot of strange values for whether the post was edited. I wonder what that's about? I'll probably need to find a way to clean it up. For now, I'll just categorize those funny data points as "funny".

```{R}
editTable <- table(dTrain$post_was_edited, dTrain$requester_received_pizza)
editTable <- as.data.frame.matrix(editTable)
editTable <- editTable[3:nrow(editTable),] # Isolate messy data

# For some reason a table returns strange results, so will do this manually
editTableFalse <- editTable[,1]
editTableTrue <- editTable[,2]
```

The results for the funny edit data to fulfillment were...

FALSE | TRUE
--- | ---
203 | 96

Bummer! I was hoping it'd be more unanimous one way. Anyway, let's report on the statistic that I'm looking for now.

Alright, so reporting the result I actually care about now...

```{R}
editTable <- table(dTrain$post_was_edited, dTrain$requester_received_pizza)
editTable <- as.data.frame.matrix(editTable)
editTable <- editTable[1:2,]
editTable[3,] <- c(203, 96)
```

Edited | FALSE | TRUE
--- | --- | ---
No Edit | 2646 (65.5%) | 749 (18.5%)
Edit | 197 (4.9%) | 149 (3.7%)
Funny | 203 (5.0%) | 96 (2.4%)

So it looks like that bit of intuition was wrong. Posts that are edited are not more likely to have been fulfilled than posts that were not.
